# Hi, I'm Enio Mecaj

Electrical and Electronic Engineer based in the UK with a passion for Arduino, embedded systems, and hands-on repairs. I enjoy building purposeful hardware projects that combine creativity, logic, and real-world problem solving.

## About Me

I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and have a strong interest in embedded development and prototyping. I'm currently exploring ways to deepen my skills in:

- Microcontroller programming (Arduino, ATmega)
- Sensor integration and signal processing
- Python for hardware interfacing and automation
- Repairing and restoring consumer tech
- PCB design and low-level embedded systems

I'm open to global job opportunities, sponsorships, and collaborative projects.
